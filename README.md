## Usage Notes
(Usage notes are taken from [this Archived page][notes].)

To install:

1. download and unzip the plugin.
2. Copy it to your plugins directory. Make sure it's world-readable.
3. Modify a head or foot file to include $calendar::calendar, $calendar::month_calendar or $calendar::year_calendar
4. Try it out â€” load your blog in your browser. If you see a calendar, great!
5. Look at your error log. Verify you have an 'enabled' line.
6. If you're wanting to verify caching is working, load the page again, and now look for an error log line "calendar debug 1: Using cached state"
7. Once you're satisfied it's working, edit the $debug_level configuration variable to 0. There are a couple other configuration variables you may wish to change, too.
8. Drop me a note to let me know you're using it; if you're having problems, let me know and I might be able to help. If everything's working okay, please let me know that, too.
